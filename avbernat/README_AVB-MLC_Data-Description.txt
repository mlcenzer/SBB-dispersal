ABSTRACT

As environments change, often drastically, due to human activities, dispersal-behavioral plasticity can be a key mediator for metapopulation connectivity and the interactions between an individual and its altered environment. Our goal was to investigate the traits and ecological processes that affect plastic dispersal responses within an insect-host system undergoing human-induced rapid evolutionary change (HIREC). Since the 1960s, populations of the red-shouldered soapberry bug from Florida, USA, originally feeding on the seeds of Cardiospermum corindum on the islands, quickly adapted to feeding on an invasive, ornamental tree, Koelreuteria elegans, on the mainland, which led to host-specific wing polyphenism. Here, we measured the morphology of >3,500 soapberry bugs field collected from 2013 to 2020 and the flight performance of 378 total soapberry bugs tested in a flight mill during Fall 2019 and Winter 2020. Flight tests showed females and mainland natives exhibited variable flight responses mediated by mass, while males were consistent, wing-dependent flyers. However, historical specimens showed annual rises in flightless morphs for males and dwindling wing-to-body sizes for island natives since 2013. Despite uncertain future demographic consequences, plasticity could help predict mobility character and agent dispersal behavior and ultimately help identify whether recent trends signal adjustment or maladaptation to HIREC.



METHODS


J. haematoloma morphology from 2013 to 2020 (2013-2020_Morphology_Data)

	Red-shouldered soapberry bugs (SBB), Jadera haematoloma, were collected in 1 to 8 locations in Florida at least once a year from April 2013 to February 2020. Each seasonal bug collection contained a mix of soapberry bugs selected from their native host plant, Cardiospermum corindum, and nonnative host plant, Koelreuteria elegans. All bugs were shipped to Davis, CA [2013-2016]; Tallahassee, FL [2017]; Chapel Hill, NC [2018]; or Chicago, IL [2019-2020] and were either preserved in ethanol in 50 mL falcon tubes by population or preserved after laboratory experiments. We took morphological measurements for each soapberry bug collected, using Mitutoyo digital calipers and a Zeiss Stemi 1000 Microscope 7x – 35x. Measurements included the distance from the rostrum to the tip of the wing (body length), pronotum width at the widest point (thorax width), beak length, and forewing length. 

	Morphology measurements from 2013 to 2020 were continually amended to a central data file (allmorphology05.18.21.csv) either manually or through code (i.e. see "update_on_<date>" folders within the SBB-dispersal repository: https://github.com/mlcenzer/SBB-dispersal/tree/master/avbernat/All_Morphology). Updates also included cleaning typos, adding coordinates, defining known diapausing status, and adding the exact known field collection date. To include these new columns, the values were mapped, mostly via code, according to the known host plant, population, year, month, and season of collection.

	There is one central Rmd script, appendix_A-wing_summary.Rmd, that processes and analyzes the morphology dataset. There are four sourced scripts that accompany this script: one that standardizes and centers values of the data for analysis (clean_morph_data.R), one that removes bugs with torn wings (remove_torn_wings.R), one that conducts model comparisons based on AIC (compare_models.R), and one that calculates model probabilities (get_Akaike_weights.R). To efficiently run all scripts, ensure that 1) the directory structure follows the same hierarchical folder organization as shown in https://github.com/mlcenzer/SBB-dispersal/tree/master/avbernat and that 2) the directory, "dir", path in the Rmd script has been updated to the user's local profile path. When the Rmd script is "knit" to PDF, the user will notice that not all code chunks are displayed. For any code chunks not displayed, comments are emedded in the code to explain R computations, plotting, and statistics. 


J. haematoloma flight trials in Fall 2019 and Winter 2020 (Seasonal_Flight_Data)

	For flight trials, soapberry bugs were collected during the Fall 2019 and Winter 2020 season in eight locations in Florida and shipped to Chicago, IL. In the three archipelago sites, bugs were collected from C. corindum; in the five mainland sites, bugs were collected from K. elegans. To measure the flight performance of a SBB, a flight mill machine was built and used, which functioned by recording flight movement via voltage measurements (see Bernat A., 2021). In other words, the machine acted like a "insect-powered carousel" where a SBB, magnetically attached to one end of a flight mill arm, would fly in circles while the flag on the other end of the arm would break an IR sensor beam at each revolution. Breaking the IR sensor would create a drop in voltage that was recorded. These dips or troughs of voltage would be processed after converting the WDH files into TXT files. 

	Processing the recording TXT files required at least three central python scripts: one that split files (e.g. split_files.py), one that stanardizes the voltages by converting changes in voltage into a TXT file of flight instances (e.g. standardize_troughs.py), and one that computes flight total distance, max and average speeds, total duration, and various other flight performance metrics (e.g. flight_analysis.py). Script names varry by testing season. The following list summaries the scripts for Fall 2019: 0.appending_files.py (appends recording TXT files into a single flight trial), 0.demographics.py (merges handwritten trial data with demographic data), 1.splitting_files (splits recording TXT files with multiple tested bugs into separate TXT files for each bug), 2.standardize_peaks_multiple_files (identifies flight instances), 3.flight_analysis_multiple_files (computes and generates a flight statistics summary CSV sheet), 4.merging_data.py (merges flight statistics with handwritten trial data, demographic data, and morphology data), and flight_graphs.py (plots speed (m/s) vs. seconds from start (s)). The sourced script get_IDs_expanded.py (creates a dictionary that maps filenames to bug IDs).

	For individuals tested in Winter 2020, the following scripts were used: appending_files.py (appends recording TXT files into a single flight trial), 0.checking_event_markers.py (checks event marker and handwritten trial data accuracy), 1.updating_overnight_time.py (updates the overnight flyers on the handwritten trial data with their WDH file observed flight end time), 3.split_files.py (splits recording TXT files with multiple tested bugs into separate TXT files for each bug), 4.standardize_troughs.py (identifies flight instances), 5.flight_analysis.py (computes and generates a flight statistics summary CSV sheet), 6.merging_data.py (merges flight stats with handwritten trial data, egg laying data, demographic data, and morphology data).

	Following trial data Python processing, there is one central Rmd script, appendix_B-flight_summary.Rmd, that refines and analyzes the Fall 2019 and Winter 2020 flight trial dataset. There are ten sourced scripts that accompany this script: two that standardize values of the data for analysis (clean_flight_data.R and clean_flight_data-Fall.R), two that reformat the data from unique rows to rows grouped by ID (unique_flight_data.R, unique_flight_data-Fall.R), one that centers values of the data regardless the data are formated as unique rows or grouped rows (center_flight_data.R), one that conducts model comparisons based on AIC (compare_models.R), one that calculates model probabilities (get_Akaike_weights.R), one that wrangles multinomial models into tidy tables or graphs (multinom_functions.R), one that calculates model prediction accuracies (prediction_accuracy.R), and one that calculates additional model performance metrics and aids in plotting a confusion matrix (confusion_matrix.R). As already recommended, to efficiently run these scripts, ensure that 1) the directory structure follows the same hierarchical folder organization as shown in https://github.com/mlcenzer/SBB-dispersal/tree/master/avbernat and that 2) the directory, "dir", path in the Rmd script has been updated to the user's local profile path. When the Rmd script is "knit" to PDF, the user will notice that not all code chunks are displayed. For any code chunks not displayed, comments are emedded in the code to explain R computations, plotting, and statistics. 


USAGE NOTES

J. haematoloma morphology from 2013 to 2020 (2013-2020_Morphology_Data)

	Morphology data from 2013 to 2020 (collected and measured by MLC and recently assisted by AVB) of J. haematoloma. Columns are as follows: pophost (plant species SBB collected from), population (census-designated location name of collection), site (location name acting as proxi to coordinates), sex (either M for male or F foer female), beak (SBB beak length (mm)), thorax (pronotum width at widest point (mm)), wing (forewing length at longest point (mm)), body (length from tylus tip to forewing tip (mm)), month (month SBB collected), year (year SBB collected), months_since_start (month count since first collection month; April 2013 initializes the count), season (season SBB collected), w_morph (wing morph; either long-winged (L), short-winged (S) or ambigiuous (LS or SL)), lat (latitude of collection (°)), long (longitude of collection (°)), diapause (either SBB was observed in a state of arrested movement or not during collection), field_date_collected (exact collection date), and notes (additional notable descriptions of SBB features). NAs and blanks indicate that the measurement for the individual was not taken except in the "notes" column where a blank or NA suggests that there were no immediately concerning or notable features about the individual.

J. haematoloma flight trials in Fall 2019 and Winter 2020 (Seasonal_Flight_Data)

	Flight trial data during Fall 2019 and Winter 2020 using a flight mill machine (collected by AVB and assisted by MLC) of J. haematoloma. Relevant columns are as follows: ID (SBB identification number), trial_type (either T1 for trial 1 or T2 for trial 2), chamber (data logger label hypoenated with channel number), set_number (reference number to a group of trials), average_speed (mean speed (m/s) measured across a trial), max_speed (fastest speed (m/s) measured across a trial), total_duration or recording_duration (total trial length (s)), total_flight_time (time SBB spend flying within a trial (s)), portion_flying (portion of time in flight compared to total trial duration), distance (total distance flew within a trial), test_date (date SBB flight tested), time_start (time flight trial initiated in CST or UTC/GMT-06:00), time_end (time flight trial terminated in CST or UTC/GMT-06:00; terminated either by experimental design limit or by SBB volition), population (census-designated location name of collection), site (location name acting as proxi to coordinates), host_plant (plant species SBB collected from), sex (either M for male or F foer female), flew (either Y for observed flight behavior or N for absent flight movement), flight_type (flight behavior type, either bursting (B), continuous (C) or a mix (e.g. BC, CB)), died (Y if SBB died before trial), NOTES (additional descriptions of trial day observations), mass (mass measurement (g) of SBB before its flight trial), short.wing (Y if SBB was short-winged), eggs or EWM (Y if female SBB laid eggs on the day of flight trial; abbreviated from "eggs when massed"), total_eggs (count of eggs laid by females during entire experimental period), latitude (latitude of collection (°)), longitude (longitude of collection (°)), and tested (either "yes" if tested or "no" if not). The following columns replicate the aformentioned morphology column definitions: beak, thorax, wing, body, w_morph, and notes or morph_notes.

	A SBB with an ID of "0" suggests that the bug was not tested and, in turn, not given a unique ID. Additionally, if a SBB was not tested all of its values are either "0", blank, or NA except for its morphology measurements, sex, population, site, and host plant. For individuals that were tested, missing values can be interpreted as follows: a blank or NA suggests that the value was not recorded except in the NOTES, notes, or morph_notes column where a blank or NA suggests that there were not any immediately concerning or notable features about the individual. Additionally, for columns like flight_type, blanks and NAs suggest that the bug originally did not fly so it would not exhibit a flight type. Furthermore, an NA or blank in the short.wing, died, eggs, or EWM column suggest that an invdividual exhibited the negative (i.e. they were not short-winged, did not die before their trial, or did not lay eggs when massed).
